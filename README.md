# Typography Reworkings

From time to time I find articles, texts or poems which I really like. But in
some of those cases the text is typeset in such a poor way that it makes me 
sad. For me, typography has the same role as rhetoric--the way in which you 
say something can have a totally different impact and I think this is equally
true for text and typography.

Sometimes I take time and make an effort to typeset the text in a better way.
I have decided to publish some of these workings here from time to time.
